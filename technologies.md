#### Technologies we are using:
* React
* JSX
* Firebase
* NPM
* Git
* React-Router
* Reactstrap
* VSCode

Luckily, most of these technologies were used in INFO 343/340, which we have all taken. While all of us may not be experts with all of these technologies, we all have a basic foundation & understanding of each

#### Technology we want to learn but don’t need:
* Angular.js (we have react)
* Tensorflow (we don’t need ML)
* Node.js (we don’t need a backend)
* Django (we don’t need a backend)
* MongoDB (we are using firebase)
* Vue.js (using react)
* Keras (we don’t need ML)
* Typescript (we don’t need strict typing)
* AWS/Azure (using GCP)
