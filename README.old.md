*Our Problem Statement:*
"With the advent of social media, finding friends who share passions and desires should be easier than ever. However, most people still seem to have trouble finding community events, team projects, or simply finding friends in their every day life to do things with. While some people find making new friends easier, things like planning out schedules, finding shared interests, places to go, and transportation can be tedious and deter new groups and friendships from forming."
